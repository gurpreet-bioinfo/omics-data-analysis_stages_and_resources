## 🧬 What are the three stages of NGS/Omics (WGS/WES) data analysis? How do you start, and keep your workflow stress-free and organized? 📒

### 💡 Understanding each stage is essential for obtaining reliable and interpretable results; whether for research or clinical applications.

#### 1️⃣ Primary analysis: 
Generate DNA sequencing data from biological samples by converting sequencing instrument signals into sequence reads.

#### 2️⃣ Secondary/Upstream analysis: 
Identify DNA variants (mutations) through read alignment and variant calling.

#### 3️⃣ Tertiary/Downstream analysis: 
Annotate, filter/prioritize, classiﬁy and report variants.
